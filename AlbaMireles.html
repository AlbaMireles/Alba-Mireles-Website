        <div class="subheading mb-5">Language MajorðŸ’¬</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alba Mireles and I am a Third-Year student at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Languages. I am a 20-year old Mexican-American woman from San Diego, California with 2 older brothers that are 3-6 years apart from me. I graduated from Chula Vista High School in 2017 as an Arts Major. I studied music while in high school and was part of my high school band where I was Flute Section Leader my senior year and was awarded the Most Outstanding Member. I have been a Flute player for about 9 years and am continuing in my colleges concert band as well. I really love music and thought of pursuing a minor in music education but the workload was too much for me and decided not to.<br><br>

        My primary language for my major is Spanish but I am also learning Italian and Korean. I decided to study languages as I find them very interesting and love the cultures of different countries. I like to see what makes people from other places different from me and find that studying their language and culture helps me understand more of what theyâ€™re like and what they experience. I find Asian culture really interesting as it is way different from the Mexican culture I grew up with and decided to study Korean for both my love of Korean music and the culture. I decided to study Italian as it was the most similar to Spanish but I also find Italy to be a beautiful place and wish to visit one day and wish to communicate with the people there.   I really love to travel and hope to find a job that will let me experience new things and places.<br><br>

        I enjoy hobbies such as traveling and listening to music. Whenever I have the time and money to, I like to fly to other countries such as Korea and Japan with my parents. I am really into K-pop at the moment and follow my favorite groups such as BTS and ATEEZ on social media sites and try to keep up-to-date with their music releases whenever I have time amidst my busy work and school schedule.
        
        I was born and raised in San Diego with my 2 older brothers and parents. My parents were both born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico but came over with their families when they were young and became American citizens. I was surrounded by the Spanish language from a very young age as my mom wasnâ€™t fluent in English and could only communicate with us in Spanish but understood language as my dad is fluent in English as he had learned it from a very young age. I also have many aunts and uncles who only spoke Spanish and I felt bad that I couldnâ€™t communicate as well as I hoped and so I decided to learn Spanish in 4th grade from my mother. I am very close to my mother and we do almost everything together such as go to concerts of our favorite groups/bands or just hang out at the mall for a day.
